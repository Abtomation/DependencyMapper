# Uploading to GitHub

This guide will help you upload this project to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one
2. [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your computer
3. Configure Git with your username and email:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

## Steps to Upload

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and log in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., "dependency-mapper")
4. Add a description (optional)
5. Choose whether to make it public or private
6. Do NOT initialize with a README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
7. Click "Create repository"

### 2. Initialize Git in Your Local Project

Open a terminal/command prompt and navigate to your project directory:

```bash
cd path/to/dependency-mapper
```

Initialize Git:

```bash
git init
```

### 3. Add Your Files to Git

Add all files (except those in .gitignore):

```bash
git add .
```

Commit the files:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

### 4. Link Your Local Repository to GitHub

Connect your local repository to the GitHub repository (replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username):

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/dependency-mapper.git
```

### 5. Push Your Code to GitHub

Push your code to GitHub:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Note: If you're using an older version of Git, you might need to use `master` instead of `main`:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

### 6. Verify Your Upload

1. Go to your GitHub repository page
2. Refresh the page if needed
3. You should see all your files uploaded

## Adding Screenshots

After uploading:

1. Take screenshots of your application
2. Add them to the `screenshots` folder
3. Commit and push them:
   ```bash
   git add screenshots/
   git commit -m "Add screenshots"
   git push
   ```
4. Update the image URLs in README.md to point to your actual repository

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues

If you encounter authentication issues, you might need to:

1. Use a personal access token instead of your password
2. Set up SSH keys for GitHub

See [GitHub's authentication documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication) for more details.
